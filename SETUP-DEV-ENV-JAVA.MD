# Welcome to the 2022 Systematic Workshops!

## DOWNLOAD TOOLS

- ### [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/fileadmin/winrar-versions/winrar/winrar-x64-611.exe) or [7-ZIP](https://www.7-zip.org/a/7z2107-x64.exe) (if you don't have something similar already)
- ### Java Azul Zulu JDK 11 - [Latest .zip version](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-11-lts&os=windows&package=jdk)
- ### IntelliJ IDEA:
    - #### we recommend [Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windowsZip&code=IIC) since it's more than enough for Java SE.
    - #### you can also download the [Ultimate Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windowsZip) on a 30-day trial.
