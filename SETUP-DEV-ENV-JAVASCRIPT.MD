# Welcome to the 2022 Systematic Workshops!

## DOWNLOAD TOOLS

- ### Node JS - [Latest .msi LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- ### IDE:
    - #### we recommend [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windowsZip&code=IIC) since it's more than enough for Javascript and Typescript.
    - #### you can also download [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/download-thanks.html) on a 30-day trial.
